# IFSC Scraper and Data Visualizer

## Overview
This project contains both a backend and frontend component. The backend component is in charge of scraping data from the IFSC website through their undocumented API. Services are then created to show events, athletes and country stats. Athletes can also be selected to compare rankings in different events. The front end component displays the data with tables and graphs.

## App Link
Currently running on free tier of Render so the service shuts down from inactivity. Run backend first then frontend so backend is available when frontend boots back up.
